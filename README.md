### 🧐 Problem

---

This document addresses the issue of regional imbalance in South Korea, where urban areas are developing at a faster rate than rural areas, resulting in a significant gap in socioeconomic status. According to the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute, that the tourism industry can help address this issue by creating local jobs, revitalizing the economy, and preserving local cultural heritage. The solution aims to create a balanced and sustainable society by promoting tourism in less developed areas of the country.

We chose the four SDGs because it aligns with our goal to reduce economic disparities between regions, protect local culture and heritage, and promote local destinations and culture.

Target 11.4 aligns with our goal of preserving local culture and heritage. By providing a platform to promote and share information about local cultural sites and traditions, we can raise awareness and encourage their preservation.

Target 11.a focuses on supporting positive economic, social, and environmental links between urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. Our solution aims to promote local tourism and create jobs in rural areas, thus helping to balance economic development between regions.

Target 3.4 aims to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote mental health and well-being. Our solution promotes outdoor activities and walking tours, which can improve physical health and mental well-being.

Finally, Target 8.9 aligns with our goal of promoting sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products. Our solution encourages users to explore and appreciate local culture and heritage, supporting the development of sustainable tourism in the region.
